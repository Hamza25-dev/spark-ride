# TODO: Implement Reusable Cards UI Component

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Create a new reusable Cards component (src/components/Cards.jsx) that accepts data props and renders a grid of cards using shadcn/ui Card component.
- [x] Ensure the component is flexible: accepts an array of objects with properties like title, description, image, etc.
- [ ] Optionally, refactor CustomerFeedback.jsx to use the new Cards component if it improves reusability (keep carousel structure if needed).
- [ ] Test the component by integrating it into the app and running the dev server to verify rendering.

## Progress:
- [x] Plan approved by user.
- [x] Created Cards.jsx component.
